	* Reverting to older version .31_rt10 from .31_rt11
		- decision was wrong, updates should continue in testing
		- in consideration of http://bugs.archaudio.org/task/10
		- sloppy handling; we'll try not to let this happen again

	* Initial commit
	* kernel26rt 2.6.29.5_rt21-1 (upstream 2.6.29.5-rt21)

	List of differences from archlinux/core/kernel26:

		- Timer frequency set to 1000HZ
		- Disabled APM (default in x86_64)
		- Enabled HPET
		- Included Sequencer dummy client module
		- Removed staging drivers *

		* The comedi drivers seem to have an issue with
		  the rcupreempt stuff. As the staging drivers
		  are merely development inclusions, it's better
		  to omit them altogether. If you want to develop
		  rather than use this kernel for realtime work,
		  kernel26 would be a better bet.

	Remarks:

		Previously not all include directories were needed to
		build external modules. Drivers like nvidia and vmware
		seem to depend on some headers in there. Anyone
		concerned about this can check with the kernel devs
		upstream. All we care about is that the kernel, along
		with external modules, build and work as expected.
		You may also take a look at the comments in the PKGBUILD
		for the Arch bug report link(s).
